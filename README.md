# Dio Geo

_Test your geography knowledge of za warudo._

## About

Dio Geo is a Scala.js and [Slinky](https://slinky.dev/) geography quiz app. It uses React's SVG
support for the map.

You can [try the app out here](https://reibitto.github.io/dio-geo/).

Also please note that I didn't choose the borders for the map or decide what is and is not a country. I'm just using
[Simple SVG World Map](https://github.com/flekschas/simple-world-map). There's an issue for
[adding more maps](https://github.com/reibitto/dio-geo/issues/1) or [locale support](https://github.com/reibitto/dio-geo/issues/2) if you're interested.

## Contributing

I mainly created this to evaluate Slinky, but if you'd like to contribute regardless feel free to. I may or may not
get to it myself eventually.
